# simpleBolgApp
This is simple blog app where you can add posts, edit them, delete, add images and delete them.
Login page, register page, and common blog feature.

Tech stack used. JS, React, react router dom, scss, express, mysql.

This is not finished app, it has missing functionalities which i will try to fix in the future.

On the positive side:
  - Not large ammounts of code in one file,
  - I think the directories structure is pretty good.
  - Connection with database works well.
  - React components looks pretty nice.
  
 What could be better:
  - Im not satisfied with some places in few files, I could create more variables to spare some place, and write less code.
  - Image uploading works, but doesnt show them on the page, just keeps in directory. Have no idea what is the issue. Code looks ok.
  
  I will try to upgrade few things in the future, so hopefully everything will works very well..
